## For Question 1 and 2
You should download all the files in the 'NBASalaryPredictrorQ1Q2', and you should make sure you have installed altair and pandas libraries.
Next, you should put all the files under one file folder, and then you can run 'main.py' to get the picture you want.
## For Question 3
You should download all the file in the â€˜NBASalaryPredictorQ3' and place all files in the same folder, and you should make sure you have installed plotly and pandas libraries. Next you can run the relevant files according to the relationship graph you want to obtain and the related statistical values (r-square value, etc.) you want to get. Each file is independent of the other and can be run normally provided that you have downloaded the required libraries. All output plots are also given in the folder "output plots."
## For Question 4
Download the folder 'NBASalaryPredictorQ4'.  
Download Microsoft Excel App.  
Firstly, run 'q4.py' to train the model using 'salaries_1985to2018.csv', 'salary_cap.csv' and 'players.csv'.  
Then run 'main.py'. It will guide you to input data and make prediction.  
If you want to test the model, run 'q4_test.py'. It uses data from 'test_points_2023.csv' and 'test_salary_2023.csv' to test the accuracy of the prediction program.  
The test gives you R-squared values and the percentage of relative error less than 50% of training the model WITH or WITHOUT using salary cap.  
These two test files are provided in the folder, but if you want to get them by yourself, run 'get_test_points_2023.py' and 'get_test_salary_2023.py'.  
'get_test_points_2023.py' crawls data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_totals.html  
'get_test_salary_2023.py' crawls data from http://www.espn.com/nba/salaries  
They save the data in csv files, encoding ANSI.  
You have to open the csv files with Excel and save them as encoding UTF-8 to make them readable for 'q4_test.py'  
To save a file as a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file in Excel, you can follow these steps:  
1.Open the Excel file you want to save as a CSV file.  
2.Click on the "File" tab in the top left corner of the Excel window.  
3.Click on "Save As" in the menu on the left side of the window.  
4.In the "Save As" dialog box, save the new file in this folder.  
5.In the "Save as type" dropdown menu, select "CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)".  
6.Click on the "Save" button.  
7.Excel will ask you if you want to replace the existing file with the same name, click on "OK".
